  <h1>Shawn Lennes</h1>
  <p><strong>Commercial & Revenue Operations Leader</strong></p>

  <p>
Commercial and revenue operations executive with deep experience designing and scaling pricing, forecasting, and execution systems in complex B2B manufacturing environments with large distribution and dealer networks.
Across global OEMs in industrial equipment and parts, I’ve led pricing governance, forecast discipline, and commercial operating model design that improved margin quality, increased forecast accuracy to 85–90%, and supported sustained market share growth. My work consistently sits at the intersection of strategy and execution — translating commercial intent into repeatable processes that Sales, Finance, Operations, and the channel can actually run.
I’ve built and led cross-functional teams, partnered closely with executive leadership, and implemented analytics-driven approaches to territory planning, incentive design, deal governance, and channel performance management. Whether supporting national accounts, dealer-led sales models, or vertically focused growth initiatives, I focus on clarity of economics, decision velocity, and system alignment rather than short-term heroics.
My strength is not choosing sides between manufacturer and distributor — it’s designing commercial systems where incentives, data, and decision rights are aligned so both can win sustainably.  </p>
